Al Amin is an undergraduate student of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Jagannath University, Bangladesh, with strong training in both experimental and computational biomedical research. He currently works as a Research Assistant at the Red-Green Research Centre, focusing on peptide-based drug design using computational biology approaches, while also contributing to departmental laboratory projects.\nIn his departmental research, he investigates Bangladeshi plant-derived phytochemicals as eco-friendly larvicidal alternatives to conventional insecticides. This work aligns with the One Health and microbiome framework, promoting safer and sustainable public health interventions, with applications including mosquito repellents and nanoparticle formulations.\nBeyond research, he has held leadership positions such as President of ISCB RSG Bangladesh and actively contributes to academic outreach and teaching programs.\nHe aims to integrate computational and experimental approaches in drug discovery and molecular biology, building a research career that bridges biology and computational science to advance translational biomedical innovation."

    "text": "Breast Cancer Project\n\n\nThis study uses computational approaches to identify phytochemical inhibitors from Nelumbo nucifera targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer. Two lead compounds, Anonaine and Dehydroaporheine, showed strong binding, favorable pharmacokinetics, and high drug-likeness scores, highlighting their potential as targeted therapeutics. These findings lay the groundwork for experimental validation and the development of personalized breast cancer treatments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGSK-3β Project\n\n\nThis study investigates natural product–derived inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), a key enzyme implicated in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Using in-silico approaches—including molecular docking, ADMET analysis, MD simulations, MM-GBSA, DFT, PCA, and DCCM—three promising compounds were prioritized from 36,395 natural molecules. Among them, Pinophilin C (CID_139587391) demonstrated exceptional stability and strong binding to GSK-3β, highlighting its potential as a novel therapeutic candidate for neurological disorder management."
