    "text": "Md. Al Amin is an undergraduate student of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Jagannath University, Bangladesh, with active involvement in interdisciplinary biomedical research. He is currently working as a Research Assistant, where he combines wet-lab fundamentals with computational and data-driven approaches to address biologically and clinically relevant questions.\nHis primary research interests lie in cancer bioinformatics, computational drug discovery (CADD), CRISPR-Cas9–based gene editing, and functional annotation of proteins. He has hands-on experience with bioinformatics pipelines, protein sequence and structure analysis, molecular docking, and basic molecular modeling, along with working knowledge of Python and R for biological data analysis. He has also completed specialized training in AlphaFold-based protein structure prediction and actively applies structural biology tools to study protein–ligand interactions and disease-associated targets.\nIn addition to computational research, Amin has practical exposure to molecular biology techniques, including PCR-based workflows and experimental project design, with a strong interest in integrating wet-lab validation with in silico findings. His academic focus emphasizes precision medicine, cancer target discovery, and rational drug design, particularly for complex diseases such as breast cancer.\nBeyond research, he is engaged in scientific education and community leadership. He has contributed to organizing and leading academic initiatives in computational biology and is involved in developing structured training programs to introduce students to research methodology and bioinformatics. His long-term goal is to establish a strong research career that bridges experimental biology and computational science, contributing to translational research and advanced biomedical innovation."
